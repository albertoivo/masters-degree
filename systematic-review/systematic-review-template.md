# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Equatorial Plasma Bubble Detection in All-Sky Airglow Images: A Systematic Review

## Abstract

### Background
When night falls over equatorial regions, the Earth's ionosphere sometimes develops mysterious dark regions called equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs). These plasma density depletions create serious headaches for satellite communications and GPS systems worldwide (Kelley et al., 2011; Dao et al., 2019). For decades, scientists have been manually scanning All-Sky Airglow images to spot these elusive phenomena - a tedious process that demands considerable expertise and yields inconsistent results (Martinis et al., 2003; Pimenta et al., 2007). Recently, however, researchers have begun experimenting with machine learning and deep learning techniques, hoping these computational tools might revolutionize how we detect EPBs (Alfonso et al., 2025; Githio et al., 2024).

### Objective
Our goal is straightforward: evaluate how well machine learning and deep learning algorithms perform when tasked with detecting equatorial plasma bubbles in All-Sky Airglow images. We want to compare different approaches, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and chart a course for future research.

### Methods
We conducted our literature search according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines (Page et al., 2021), casting a wide net across multiple databases. [SPECIFIC DATABASE SEARCH DETAILS WILL BE ADDED HERE]. Our inclusion criteria focused on studies that applied ML/DL algorithms to EPB detection using All-Sky Airglow imagery, published between [START DATE] and [END DATE].

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The EPB Phenomenon

Picture this: as darkness settles over equatorial regions, the ionosphere - that electrically charged layer of our atmosphere - begins to behave strangely. Plasma density suddenly drops in certain areas, creating what scientists call equatorial plasma bubbles (Woodman & La Hoz, 1976; Kelley, 2009). These weren't discovered yesterday; researchers first noticed them back in the 1970s using radar observations, but their impact on modern technology makes them more relevant than ever.

What makes EPBs particularly fascinating is their unpredictable nature. They don't just appear randomly - there's a complex physics behind their formation. The culprit is something called the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which sounds intimidating but essentially describes how plasma density gradients become unstable after sunset (Sultan, 1996; Hysell & Kudeki, 2004). Think of it like watching oil separate from water, except this happens hundreds of kilometers above our heads with electrically charged particles.

These bubble-like structures can stretch upward for hundreds of kilometers and stick around for hours (Tsunoda, 2005; Burke et al., 2004). When viewed through specialized cameras that detect 630.0 nm oxygen emissions, they appear as dark bands or voids against the glowing airglow background (Mendillo et al., 1992; Sahai et al., 2000). It's actually quite beautiful, though the implications for technology are far from pretty.

The timing and intensity of EPB occurrence isn't random either. Solar activity plays a major role - during solar maximum periods, we see significantly more bubbles, especially around equinox seasons (Tsunoda, 1985; Stolle et al., 2008). Local ionospheric conditions, geomagnetic activity, and even seasonal variations all influence whether these phenomena will develop on any given night (Abdu, 2001; Burke et al., 2004).

### 1.2 Why Detection Matters (And Why It's Hard)

Here's where things get practical. EPBs aren't just academic curiosities - they wreak havoc on satellite communications and GPS accuracy. When radio signals encounter these plasma irregularities, they scatter and fluctuate, causing what we call scintillation. For anyone relying on precise GPS positioning or satellite communications in equatorial regions, this translates to real problems.

Traditionally, scientists have relied on several detection methods, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Ionosondes provide valuable data but only point measurements (Abdu et al., 2003). GPS receivers can detect scintillation effects but don't give us the complete spatial picture (Otsuka et al., 2002). All-Sky Imagers, however, offer something special: they capture 630.0 nm oxygen emissions across the entire visible sky, providing a two-dimensional snapshot of ionospheric structures with impressive spatial and temporal resolution (Mendillo & Baumgardner, 1982; Taylor et al., 1997).

But here's the catch: interpreting these images requires significant expertise. A trained eye can spot EPB signatures, but the process is incredibly time-consuming (Martinis et al., 2003). Worse, different experts might interpret the same image differently, leading to inconsistent results (Pimenta et al., 2007). When you're dealing with thousands of images from global All-Sky Imager networks, manual analysis becomes practically impossible (Candido et al., 2011).

The situation becomes even more challenging when considering operational requirements. Weather forecasters and satellite operators need near real-time information about ionospheric conditions (Sobral et al., 2002). Manual analysis simply can't keep pace with operational demands, especially when dealing with data from networks like RENOIR or TEC-based observation systems (Makela et al., 2012; Seemala & Valladares, 2011).

### 1.3 Enter Machine Learning

This is where machine learning enters the picture, promising to transform how we approach EPB detection. The basic idea isn't revolutionary - we're essentially teaching computers to recognize patterns that human experts have been identifying manually for decades. What is revolutionary is the potential scale and consistency these automated systems offer.

Modern machine learning techniques bring several compelling advantages to the table (Jordan & Mitchell, 2015). First, they're objective - a properly trained algorithm will analyze images consistently, without the subjective variations that plague human interpretation. Second, they're fast - once trained, these systems can process images in seconds rather than minutes or hours. Third, they're scalable - the same algorithm can simultaneously analyze data from multiple stations worldwide.

The field has already seen promising developments in related areas. Convolutional Neural Networks have proven remarkably effective at classifying atmospheric phenomena in satellite imagery (Shi et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). Traditional machine learning approaches like Support Vector Machines and Random Forest algorithms have shown success in ionospheric parameter prediction (Chen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018).

More directly relevant to our focus, several recent studies have begun exploring machine learning applications specifically for EPB detection. Alfonso et al. (2025) investigated machine learning techniques using GOLD airglow images, while Githio et al. (2024) developed Random Forest models for estimating EPB drift velocities. Zhang et al. (2025) conducted statistical analysis of machine learning-derived EPB characteristics using All-Sky observations.

### 1.4 Why This Review Matters

Despite growing interest in applying AI to EPB detection, the field lacks a comprehensive overview of what works, what doesn't, and why. Previous reviews have either focused on traditional detection methods (Burke et al., 2004) or covered machine learning in ionospheric research more broadly (McGranaghan et al., 2021). None have specifically examined the application of ML/DL techniques to EPB detection in optical airglow data.

This gap matters because EPB detection presents unique challenges that differ from other atmospheric or ionospheric applications. The subtle nature of plasma depletion signatures, the variability in background airglow conditions, and the need for high accuracy in operational environments all create specific requirements that generic machine learning approaches might not address effectively.

Understanding which algorithms work best, what preprocessing steps are most effective, and where current approaches fall short is essential for developing reliable operational systems (Bust & Mitchell, 2008; Schunk & Nagy, 2009). Researchers need this information to avoid duplicating efforts and to build on successful approaches rather than starting from scratch.

### 1.5 What We're Trying to Answer

This systematic review tackles five key questions that we believe will advance the field:

1. Which machine learning and deep learning algorithms have researchers actually applied to EPB detection in All-Sky Airglow images? (We want a complete inventory of approaches tried so far.)

2. How do these different algorithms compare in terms of real performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score? (Numbers matter, but context matters more.)

3. What technical challenges and limitations keep surfacing in different studies? (Learning from failures is often more valuable than celebrating successes.)

4. Which preprocessing techniques and feature extraction methods seem to work best? (The devil is often in these details.)

5. Based on current evidence, what should researchers focus on next? (We want to provide a roadmap, not just a summary.)

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Planning and Registration

Before diving into the literature search, we registered our systematic review protocol [REGISTRATION DETAILS TO BE ADDED] to ensure transparency and minimize potential bias. This approach follows best practices recommended for systematic reviews (Shamseer et al., 2015) and helps prevent the temptation to adjust our methodology based on what we find.

### 2.2 Casting the Net: Search Strategy

#### 2.2.1 Where We Looked

Finding relevant studies required searching multiple databases, since this interdisciplinary topic spans engineering, physics, and computer science literature (Gusenbauer & Haddaway, 2020). We systematically searched:

- IEEE Xplore Digital Library (for engineering and computer science papers)
- Scopus (comprehensive multidisciplinary coverage)
- Web of Science Core Collection (strong in physical sciences)
- Google Scholar (broader coverage including conference papers)
- PubMed (catches interdisciplinary work)
- arXiv preprint server (emerging research)
- AGU Publications (specialized geophysics journals)

#### 2.2.2 Search Terms and Strategy

Developing effective search terms required balancing specificity with comprehensiveness. Too narrow, and we'd miss relevant studies; too broad, and we'd drown in irrelevant results. After several iterations and pilot searches, we settled on this approach (following Bramer et al., 2017):

**EPB and plasma bubble terms:**
"equatorial plasma bubble*" OR "EPB" OR "plasma bubble*" OR "ionospheric irregularit*" OR "plasma depletion*"

**Imaging and observation terms:**
"All-Sky" OR "airglow" OR "630.0 nm" OR "optical observation*" OR "atmospheric imaging" OR "ionospheric imaging"

**Machine learning terms:**
"machine learning" OR "deep learning" OR "neural network*" OR "convolutional neural network*" OR "CNN" OR "artificial intelligence" OR "computer vision" OR "pattern recognition" OR "automated detection" OR "image classification" OR "support vector machine*" OR "random forest" OR "ensemble learning"

Our final search string looked like this:
("equatorial plasma bubble*" OR "EPB" OR "plasma bubble*" OR "ionospheric irregularit*") AND ("All-Sky" OR "airglow" OR "630.0 nm" OR "atmospheric imaging") AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning" OR "neural network*" OR "CNN" OR "artificial intelligence" OR "automated detection")

#### 2.2.3 Beyond Database Searches

Systematic searches often miss important studies, so we supplemented our database searches with several additional approaches (Greenhalgh & Peacock, 2005):

- Manually checking reference lists of included studies
- Forward citation tracking of key papers
- Reviewing conference proceedings from major scientific meetings (AGU, URSI, IEEE)
- Reaching out to known experts in ionospheric physics and machine learning

### 2.3 Deciding What to Include

#### 2.3.1 Inclusion Criteria

We kept our inclusion criteria relatively broad to capture the full range of approaches researchers have attempted. Studies needed to meet all of these requirements:

- Applied machine learning or deep learning algorithms (any type)
- Focused on detecting or classifying equatorial plasma bubbles
- Used All-Sky Airglow imagery as the primary data source
- Written in English
- Provided sufficient methodological detail for evaluation
- Published between [DATE RANGE TO BE SPECIFIED]

We included peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, and preprints, recognizing that some of the most recent work in this rapidly evolving field might only be available as preprints.

#### 2.3.2 Exclusion Criteria

Several types of studies fell outside our scope:
- Studies using only traditional (non-ML/DL) detection methods
- Research focused on other ionospheric phenomena without addressing EPB detection
- Work using data sources other than All-Sky Airglow imaging
- Review articles, editorials, or opinion pieces without original research
- Studies lacking sufficient methodological information
- Duplicate publications of the same research

#### 2.3.3 The Selection Process

Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts, using [SCREENING SOFTWARE TO BE SPECIFIED]. This parallel approach helps catch studies that one reviewer might miss and reduces selection bias (Higgins et al., 2019). For potentially relevant studies, we retrieved full-text articles and had both reviewers independently assess them against our inclusion criteria.

When reviewers disagreed (which happened occasionally), we discussed the case and consulted a third reviewer if needed. This process helped ensure consistent application of our criteria across all studies.

### 2.4 Extracting the Good Stuff

#### 2.4.1 What We Recorded

We developed a comprehensive data extraction form based on established frameworks for machine learning systematic reviews (Luo et al., 2016). For each included study, we recorded:

**Basic study information:** Authors, publication year, journal/conference, study design, geographic location of observations, time period covered, and dataset size.

**Technical details:** ML/DL algorithm type and architecture, input data preprocessing methods, feature extraction approaches, training/validation/testing splits, hardware and software used, and key hyperparameters.

**Performance data:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC values, confusion matrices, processing times, and computational requirements.

**EPB-specific details:** How EPBs were defined and labeled, temporal and spatial resolution of observations, environmental conditions considered, and validation approaches used.

### 2.5 Assessing Study Quality

Not all studies are created equal, so we needed a systematic way to evaluate quality. We adapted established criteria for machine learning studies (Luo et al., 2016; Wohlin et al., 2012), focusing on:

- How clearly the methodology was described
- Whether the dataset was appropriate in size and quality
- What validation strategy was used (crucial for ML studies)
- Whether baseline comparisons were included
- How reproducible the results appear to be
- What steps were taken to minimize bias

### 2.6 Making Sense of It All

Given the diversity we expected in study designs, algorithms, and outcome measures, we planned primarily for narrative synthesis (Popay et al., 2006). However, if we found sufficient similarity among studies, we remained open to meta-analysis for specific performance metrics, following established guidelines for meta-analysis of machine learning studies (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014).

## 3. Results

### 3.1 What Our Search Uncovered

[PRISMA FLOW DIAGRAM PLACEHOLDER]

Our comprehensive database search initially identified [NUMBER] records across all databases. After removing duplicates (which were surprisingly common given the interdisciplinary nature of this topic), we screened [NUMBER] unique records by title and abstract. This screening phase eliminated many studies that were clearly outside our scope - typically because they dealt with different ionospheric phenomena or used non-ML approaches.

We then retrieved [NUMBER] full-text articles for detailed evaluation. At this stage, we excluded several studies that initially seemed relevant but lacked sufficient methodological detail or used data sources other than All-Sky Airglow imagery. Our final analysis includes [NUMBER] studies that met all inclusion criteria.
